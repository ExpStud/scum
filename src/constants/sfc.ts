I remember still having a slight fever, but I was well enough to enjoy a day at home with my parents. Dad put on a movie, and Mom brought me a bowl of chicken noodle soup. This piece is meant to capture that tranquil feeling of being sick but on the mend, knowing that things are getting better and a fresh start is on the horizon. This is similar to my experience of burnout: I push myself too hard, lose energy, and then take time to rest before beginning again. Sometimes, this period of rest leads to a reinvention, that allows me to return with renewed vigor and a fresh perspective.",
